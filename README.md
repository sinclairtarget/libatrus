# Atrus
A MyST document engine. Atrus parses [MyST-flavored
Markdown](https://mystmd.org/spec/overview) and can output MyST AST or HTML.
Other renderers might be added in the future.

MyST is a superset of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), so Atrus is also
a CommonMark-compliant Markdown parser and HTML renderer.
